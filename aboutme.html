          <p id = "introPrgph" >Hi, I'm Sergio. I live in Portland, Oregon. I am currently at Computer Science student at Oregon State Univeristy. I hope to graduate by the end of 2019.</p>

          <p>I originally came to Oregon from Mexico when I was nine years old. I love it here. I embraced Oregon and eventually attended the University of Oregon. As a Duck, I majored in Ecnomics & Finance. After working in commercial banking after college, I became interested in the technological changes in the industry. As much as other industries have been "disrupted" by technology, I think finance is a field that has ways to go in terms of technological advancement. I there is untapped value that cannot be delivered through traditional means of banking/investing. Upon completion of the Computer Science program at Oregon State Univeristy, I would love to work in developing technologies for the financial industry, but I am open to any company that is a good fit. </p>

        <h2>Real About Me</h2>

        <p> If we are going to work together, you may as well understand my hobbies and habits, right? I'm a pretty simple person, laid-back person. Here is what enjoy:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>I enjoy spending time with my parents and siblings.</li>
          <li>Although, I am now an OSU Beaver, I like attending Oregon Duck Football games in the Fall.</li>
          <li>Breakfast foods. Ask me to make you a breakfast sandwhich anytime :)</li>
          <li>Pizza. I will never get tired of Apizza Scholls. I also make pizza and will make some for you.</li>
          <li>Oregon Coast. I like Mt. Hood too, but I always tend to get injured :(</li>
          <li>Beer. Not related to Brett Kavanaugh, I promise. </li>
        </ul>
