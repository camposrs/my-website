				<h1>Me and Food</h1>

				<p class="firstP">In the past three years or so, my relationship food went through a paradigm shift. I began to see food as more than just a tool or nourishment. As I ate out more often, I began to appreciate the beauty of food across cultures. Food slowly became a way to understand the story of a culture from a unique vantage point. Food can tell us a lot about a regionâ€™s history by its ingredients. For instance, tomatoes are closely associated with Italian food, but they are native to Central America. What does that tell us? It tells us that there must have been an intersection of cultures that led to the adoption of tomatoes by Italians. Of course, most of us understand that the colonization of the Americas led to the export of the plant for cultivation in Europe.</p>

				<p>Many meals have a special meaning to me now. Whether it is a special occasion or a weekday dinner, my plate feels like a story book. After spending too much money eating out, I began to cook. I had cooked some meals in college, but they did not stretch beyond eggs, noodles or grilled cheese sandwiches. I had seen cooking as a chore. As my love for food grew, the paradigm shifted. Cooking became a joy. I could never draw or play musical instruments, so when my cooking did not suck, I had revelation. I could cook.</p>

				<p>As with any art form, it takes practice. It all started with closely following recipes. For example, I follow multiple recipes for making pizza from scratch. People are religious about pizza making. I learned about tens of techniques for a simple dough. Each recipe is nuanced. Each unique characteristic was said to make a huge difference in the end product. Through experimentation, I was able to see what was bullshit and what actually made a better pie. My pizza journey was mirrored when I attempted to make other iconic dishes like paella.</p>

				<p>I think cooking is a hobby that will partially define my life. I love the lessons that cooking has taught me. Part of my cooking journey has happened as a means to take a break from my computer science learning since I have to study for hours indoors. Other hobbies would take too much time away from my learning experience. Writing a program takes a similar process to creating a meal. It takes planning and careful execution. There is often a myriad of ways to approach the problems. I am excited to see both disciplines grow in my life.</p>

				<h1>Introduction</h1>

				<p class="firstP">I grew in Mexico in a small farming community out the city of <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Piedad">La Piedad</a></span>. I loved it. I had acres had hundreds of acres to roam around in. My friends and I took full advantage and explore the landscape. This was more-or-less my boy scouts experience without adult supervision or actual overnight camping. This was an amazing way to grow and I attribute the freedom that I had to explore to my creativity. In the nature vs. nurture debate, I think we are largely shaped by the our surroundings with some base level biological makeup. Being devoid of technology in Mexico allowed my mind to run wild for my entertainment. I had Dragon Ball Z action figures that I used to create epid battles with my friends. We had instructments and started our own band as kids. I the drummer. I sucked.</p>

				<p>When my parents eventually dragged my siblings and I to the United States, I finally got to use a computer for the first time at school. It was magical and I was hooked. Eventually, my family bought a computer. It was one of those computers that looked like a <span><a href="https://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/img/SE1MJDZaTvUpUAz2ooDGYvhY9r8=/830x467/2010/08/03/b7e1fe86-bb7b-11e2-8a8e-0291187978f3/31259323-2-440-overview-1.gif">tank</a></span>. I think we went through two of those in less than a year, because I kept trying to take it apart. I mean who is not curious about what makes up such an amazing device? I never stopped loving computers what they meant. I spend countless hours digging through Windows directories in Windows Explorer in high school to try to figure out how programs worked. In high school, I began to think about what I wanted to practically do with my life. I have two amazing teachers in business class that made me influenced me to go in the direction of a finance degree. I followed that path in college. I enjoyed learned about the subject and I could see myself in a finance or management role. Upon entering the workforce, I became fascinated  by the role that finance has in the economy. I had no idea how many unique businesses existed that contributed to our relatively stable society. We often think of businesses as living entities that make decisions easily and swiftly. We may often as why Company ABC won't stop a business practice. It seems easy, but the reality is that are hundreds, if not thousands of factors to consider, especially  when a large corporation is involved. I enjoy finance, because it provides the cash which is the lifeblood of businesses in our lives.</p>

				<p>I am a forward thinking person and I firmly believe that there is a better way to do business. After experiencing finance in the front lines, I thought we can do a better job of servicing commercial clients. I began to explore a computer science degree. I landed with Oregon State University. It's been an great learning experinace thus far. I have had ups and downs, but I am determined to gain the skills to contribute to progress. In my short journey, I have met with facinating people from all industries. I have began to see how I could add value to their organization. I am not going to limit myself on where I land.</p>
